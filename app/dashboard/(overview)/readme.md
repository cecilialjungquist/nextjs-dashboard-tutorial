## Convention
A route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in parenthesis: (folderName).
This convention indicates the folder is for organizational purposes and should not be included in the route's URL path.

When you create a new folder using parentheses (), the name won't be included in the URL path. So /dashboard/(overview)/page.tsx becomes /dashboard.
